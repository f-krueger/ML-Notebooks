# ML Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks to illustrate the application of some machine learning techniques. 

For reproducibility reasons, a docker file is provided.

Start the docker environment by
`sh docker.sh`

Necessary data will be downloaded and the python environment created. Finally, the Jupyter Server will be started. 
To connect to the Jupyter Server, use the URL that is printed and replace the port from `8888` to `8000`.

The notebooks are based on the Keras tutorial for the mnist dataset.
